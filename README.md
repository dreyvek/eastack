# eastack-t3

eastack-t3 is a fork of [p3-stack](https://github.com/uzairansaruzi/p3-stack), which is [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) rebuilt for T3 Code. Same engineering discipline, native T3 orchestration. The skills keep p3-stack's names (`p3-mode`, `setup-p3`, `p3-help`).

pstack is poteto's answer to AI slop code. It turns an agent into an engineering team: one mode skill that routes to playbooks, principles that ground every decision, and verification strict enough that you can parallelize with confidence. p3-stack keeps that system and rewires the mechanics to T3 Code's primitives:

- **Delegation.** `delegate_task` child agents replace Cursor's Task tool, with per-role providers and models resolved from `orchestrator_capabilities`. Cross-model panels are native.
- **Worktrees.** `t3_thread_launch` binds a worker to its own worktree and branch. One writer per worktree, enforced by the app instead of by advice.
- **Watching.** `watch_pull_request` wakes the thread when checks finish, someone comments, or the branch conflicts. No polling loops.
- **Scheduling.** `schedule_task` runs audits and overnight cadences even when no turn is active. No `/loop`.
- **Memory.** `t3_thread_read` and `t3_thread_search` replace mining Cursor transcript files.
- **Proof.** `preview_*` browser tools and `device_*` simulators replace external control skills. Screenshots and recordings land in the thread.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreyvek/eastack-t3.git
cd eastack-t3
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` links every `skills/*` directory into `~/.agents/skills/`, where T3 Code and Codex read skills, and mirrors each link into `~/.claude/skills/` as `../../.agents/skills/<name>` for Claude Code. Use `./install.sh --project /path/to/repo` to install into a project's `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` instead. The links point into this clone, so keep it where it is.

## Get started

1. Run `/setup-p3`. It reads `orchestrator_capabilities` and writes `p3-models.md`, mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a provider and model you actually have.
2. Use `/p3-mode` whenever you want rigorous work. It reads the request, picks a playbook, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.
3. Stuck or unsure which skill fits? Ask `/p3-help`.

## The mode

`p3-mode` routes every task. Its playbooks: investigation, bug fix, perf issue, hillclimb, runtime forensics, trace forensics, feature, refactoring, prototype, visual parity, authoring a skill, eval, babysit, shipping, autonomous run, orchestrate, autopilot-full, autopilot-stack, session pickup, pause safely, multi-phase plan, worktree cleanup, opening a PR.

## Skills

architect, arena, automate-me, benchmark-checklist, blast-radius, bro, correct, create-verification-skill, figure-it-out, how, interrogate, maintain-verification-skill, make-bot-ui, no-comments, p3-help, recall, reflect, setup-p3, show-me-your-work, swarm, tdd, teach, technical-writing, typescript-best-practices, unslop, why.

## Principles

The twenty-four principle skills are indexed inside `p3-mode` and referenced by the other skills by name.
